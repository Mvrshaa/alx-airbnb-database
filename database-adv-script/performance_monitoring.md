### Monitor and Refine Database Performance

Continuously monitor and refine database performance by analyzing query execution plans and applying schema or indexing improvements.

1. **Select Frequently Used Queries**
   - Identify high-traffic or slow-performing queries, especially those used in JOINs, filters, or subqueries.

2. **Use EXPLAIN and SHOW PROFILE**
   - Run each query using:
     ```sql
     EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE start_date > '2023-01-01';
     SHOW PROFILE FOR QUERY <query_id>;
     ```
   - Record execution time, rows examined, and indexes used.

3. **Identify Bottlenecks**
   - Look for signs of full table scans, unindexed joins, or large row estimates.
   - Pay attention to `type: ALL`, `rows: large number`, or `Extra: Using temporary; Using filesort`.

4. **Apply Improvements**
   - Add or refine indexes on filter and join columns.
   - Consider schema adjustments like denormalization or datatype optimization.

5. **Rerun and Compare**
   - Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` again to compare execution metrics before and after changes.
   - Validate that indexes are being used and query costs have reduced.

6. **Document and Commit**
   - Describe the original issue, the change applied, and the result.
   - Include query snapshots and `EXPLAIN` outputs.

### Example:

**Before:**
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE start_date > '2023-01-01';
```

**After Adding Index:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_start_date ON bookings(start_date);
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE start_date > '2023-01-01';
```
